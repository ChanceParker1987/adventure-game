# Debugger Steps and Analysis

## Breakpoints and Their Purpose

### Breakpoint 1: Processing User Input (Line 81)
Location: Inside addAnswerButton(), in the onclick event.  
Purpose: 
- To check if the player's choice updates currentState before calling renderQuestion().  

What Happened After Stepping Through: 
- currentState changed to nextState, meaning the playerâ€™s choice was stored.
- The program moved to renderQuestion(), which updates the game.

### Breakpoint 2: Updating the Story (Line 94)
Location: Inside renderQuestion(), where the story text is updated.  
Purpose: 
- To make sure the game displays the correct text after a choice is made.  

What Happened After Stepping Through:  
- questionContainer.textContent changed to the correct text for the new state.
- The game removed old choices and prepared for new ones.

### Breakpoint 3: Detecting the End of the Game (Line 96)
Location: Inside renderQuestion(), before choices are created.  
Purpose: 
- To check if the game detects when there are no choices left (win or game over).  

What Happened After Stepping Through:  
- If node.options.length > 0, the game continued.
- If node.options.length === 0, the game stopped, meaning it reached an ending.

## Critical Debugging State Analysis

### Breakpoint at Line 82 (renderQuestion();)
What This State Shows:  
- Execution paused right before renderQuestion() runs.
- currentState already updated to the next part of the story.
- The game is about to update the screen.

Did the Program Work Correctly? 
- Yes, currentState updated as expected.
- renderQuestion() was triggered without errors.

What Happens Next?  
- The story text updates (Breakpoint 2).
- If there are no choices left, the game detects an ending (Breakpoint 3).

The debugger confirms that the game logic works as expected.
